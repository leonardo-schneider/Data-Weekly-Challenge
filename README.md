ðŸ§  Weekly Data Challenge
Welcome to my Weekly Data Challenge project!

Every week, I choose a new dataset and go through the complete data workflow â€” from data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to basic modeling and insights generation.

The main goal of this challenge is to practice and improve my data skills using a variety of tools, including:

Excel for data exploration and initial handling

R for detailed analysis, modeling, and visualizations

Tableau for interactive dashboards and storytelling

Python for automation and more advanced techniques

Each week is stored in its own folder (e.g., Week1, Week2, ...), and contains all scripts, results, and documentation related to that dataset.

This is a personal learning project, but I hope it can also help others looking to understand how to apply data tools in a practical and consistent way. Feel free to explore the code and visualizations â€” and follow along as I grow week by week!
